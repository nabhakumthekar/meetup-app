Project is deployed on   https://radiant-hollows-19158.herokuapp.com/

1. I could complete entire project in 2 hours including deployment on Heroku.
2. Used React CLI to create project and react-bootstrap for styling.
3. Upcoming event and its information is displayed in table format.
4. When user clicks on RSVP button an alert will be displayed if RVSP is successful. That is when response returns 200 status.
5. I have used axios to make AJAX calls.
6. I have created component called MeetUpEvents.js which performs get evets call and get rsvp call.
7. componentDidMount() calls  evenetList() method which returns response data on success.
